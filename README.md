# Indian-Food-Classification using ResNet50

This project involves the classification of food images into different categories using the ResNet50 deep learning model. The dataset is split into training and test sets, and the ResNet50 model is trained on the training data to achieve accurate predictions on the test set.

# Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

->TensorFlow
->scikit-learn
->numpy
->pandas

# Model Architecture
The model architecture consists of a pre-trained ResNet50 base followed by a custom fully connected neural network. The top layers of the ResNet50 base are frozen, and additional dense layers are added for classification.

# Acknowledgments
This project uses the ResNet50 model from TensorFlow/Keras and scikit-learn for dataset splitting.
